		<h1>Explore Ngapali by bicycle</h1>
			<p>Ngapali is a quiet area with one long main road along the coastline. Rent a bike and head out early in the morning, sometime around 8:30 AM. The road is about 10 kilometers long, so you will be back before the heat of the afternoon.</p>

		<h1>Meet the friendly locals</h1>

Get in there and drive around with your bike and interact with the friendly locals who always greet you with a smile. They will be fascinated by your appearance and will try to communicate in ‘the best language’: body language.</p>

		<h1>Experience a memorable sunset</h1>

			<p>The sun position at Ngapali Beach is just perfect. In the early morning, the beach is covered in shadow, perfect for a morning walk or run. The sunsets, on the other hand, are a round-shaped sun that disappears into the ocean. Memorable!</p>
