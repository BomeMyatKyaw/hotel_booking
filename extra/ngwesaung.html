	<h1>Top Attractions</h1>
		<h2>Lovers Island</h2>
			<p>Lover’s Island is a sleeping islet on the coast of Ayeyarwady Region’s Ngwe Saung Beach. According to the locals, the name Lover’s Island is based on the mythology of star-crossed lovers expatriated from the mainland only to show off their affection among the lush foliage 500 meters from shore. However, Lover’s Island is actually a name given to foreigners since foreign couples often visit this place to have a private space. When the tide is out, parts of Bengal Bay reveal a passageway of sea-floor to Lover’s Island.</p>
		<h2>Bird Island</h2>
			<p>The island, commonly known as Bird Island, is located about 9 nautical miles from Ngwe Saung Beach. The main reason why it is called Bird Island is because there were Edible-nest swiftlet birds on the island. Bird Island is a type of rocky island, and there is no sandy soil on the island. If you go up to the mountain of the bird island, you can also visit the bird’s nest cave, where the birds live. If you go by speedboat, it may take about 50 minutes round trip. If you go by local boat, it can take about 3 hours round trip.<p>
