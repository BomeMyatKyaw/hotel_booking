                                    <p class="text-black">For regular beach rides, consider a Fat bike with 4-inch wide tyres. They prevent sinking and make pedaling easier. For occasional rides, a mountain bike with wide winter tyres and lower pressure improves grip and makes riding manageable.</p>

                                    <p class="text-black">Keep a constant pace and avoid unnecessary braking or shifting. You’ll naturally stop when you stop pedaling. On dunes, lean back and lightly touch the brake lever to control speed.</p>
